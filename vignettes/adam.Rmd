This vignette explains briefly how to use the function `adam()` and the related `auto.adam()` in `smooth` package. It does not aim at covering all aspects of the function, but focuses on the main ones.

ADAM is Advanced Dynamic Adaptive Model. It is a model that underlies ETS, ARIMA and regression, connecting them in a unified framework. The underlying model for ADAM is a Single Source of Error state space model, which will be explained in detail separately in a bookdown file (under construction at the moment).

The main philosophy of `adam()` function is to be agnostic of the provided data. This means that it will work with `ts`, `msts`, `zoo`, `xts`, `data.frame`, `numeric` and other classes of data. The specification of seasonality in the model is done using a separate parameter `lags`, so you are not obliged to transform the existing data to something specific, and can use it as is. If you provide a `matrix`, or a `data.frame`, or a `data.table`, or any other multivariate structure, then the function will use the first column for the response variable and the others for the explanatory ones. One thing that is currently assumed in the function is that the data is measured at a regular frequency. If this is not the case, you will need to introduce missing values manually.

In order to run the experiments in this vignette, we need to load the following packages:

```{r load_libraries, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
require(greybox)
require(smooth)
require(forecast)
require(Mcomp)
```

## ADAM ETS
First and foremost, ADAM implements ETS model, although in a more flexible way than [@Hyndman2008b]: it supports different distributions for the error term, which are regulated via `distribution` parameter. By default, the additive error model relies on Normal distribution, while the multiplicative error one asumes Inverse Gaussian. If you want to reproduce the classical ETS, you would need to specify `distribution="dnorm"`. Here is an example of ADAM ETS(MMM) with Normal distribution on a N2568 data from M3 competition (if you provide an `Mcomp` object, `adam()` will automatically set the train and test sets, the forecast horizon and even the needed lags):

```{r}
testModel <- adam(M3[[2568]], "MMM", lags=c(1,12), distribution="dnorm")
summary(testModel)
plot(forecast(testModel,h=18,interval="parametric"))
```

You might notice that the summary contains more than what is reported by other `smooth` functions. This one also produces standard errors for the estimated parameters based on Fisher Information calculation. Note that this is computationally expensive, so if you have a model with more than 30 variables, the calculation of standard errors might take plenty of time. As for the default `print()` method, it will produce a shorter summary from the model, without the standard errors (similar to what `es()` does):

```{r}
testModel
```

Also, note that the prediction interval in case of multiplicative error models are approximate. It is advisable to use simulations instead (which is slower, but more accurate):

```{r}
plot(forecast(testModel,h=18,interval="simulated"))
```

If you want to do the residuals diagnostics, then it is recommended to use `plot` function, something like this (you can select, which of the plots to produce):

```{r}
par(mfcol=c(3,4))
plot(testModel,which=c(1:11))
par(mfcol=c(1,1))
plot(testModel,which=12)
```

By default ADAM will estimate models via maximising likelihood function. But there is also a parameter `loss`, which allows selecting from a list of already implemented loss functions (again, see documentation for `adam()` for the full list) or using a function written by a user. Here is how to do the latter on the example of another M3 series:

```{r}
lossFunction <- function(actual, fitted, B){
  return(sum(abs(actual-fitted)^3))
}
testModel <- adam(M3[[1234]], "AAN", silent=FALSE, loss=lossFunction)
testModel
```

Note that you need to have parameters actual, fitted and B in the function, which correspond to the vector of actual values, vector of fitted values on each iteration and a vector of the optimised parameters.

`loss` and `distribution` parameters are independent, so in the example above, we have assumed that the error term follows Normal distribution, but we have estimated its parameters using a non-conventional loss because we can.

The model selection in ADAM ETS relies on information criteria and works correctly only available for the `loss="likelihood"`. There are several options, how to select the model, see them in the description of the function: `?adam`. The default one uses branch-and-bound algorithm, similar to the one used in `es()`, but only considers additive trend models (the multiplicative trend ones are less stable and need more attention from a forecaster):

```{r}
testModel <- adam(M3[[2568]], "ZXZ", lags=c(1,12), silent=FALSE)
testModel
```

Note that the function produces point forecasts if `h>0`, but it won't generate predictin interval. This is why you need to use `forecast()` method (as shown in a previous example).

Similarly to `es()` function supports combination of models, but it saves all the tested models in the output for a potential reuse. Here how it works:

```{r}
testModel <- adam(M3[[2568]], "CXC", lags=c(1,12))
testForecast <- forecast(testModel,h=18,interval="semiparametric", level=c(0.9,0.95))
testForecast
plot(testForecast)
```

Yes, now we support vectors for the levels in case you want to produce several. In fact, we also support side for prediction interval, so you can extract specific quantiles without a hustle:

```{r}
forecast(testModel,h=18,interval="semiparametric", level=c(0.9,0.95,0.99), side="upper")
```

A brand new thing in the function is the possibility to use several frequency (double / triple / quadruple / ... seasonal models). Here what we can have in case of half-hourly data:

```{r}
testModel <- adam(forecast::taylor, "MMdM", lags=c(1,48,336), silent=FALSE, h=336, holdout=TRUE)
testModel
```

Note that the more lags you have, the more initial seasonal components the function will need to estimate, which is a difficult task. The optimiser might not get close to the optimal value, so we can help it. First, we can give more time for the calculation, increasing the number of iterations via `maxeval` (the default value is 200):

```{r}
testModel <- adam(forecast::taylor, "MMdM", lags=c(1,48,336), silent=FALSE, h=336, holdout=TRUE, maxeval=5000)
testModel
```

This will take more time, but will typically lead to more refined parameters. You can control other parameters of the optimiser as well, such as `algorithm`, `xtol_rel`, `print_level` and others, which are explained in the documentation for `nloptr` function from nloptr package (run `nloptr.print.options()` for details). Second, we can give a different set of initial parameters for the optimiser, have a look at what the function saves:

```{r}
testModel$B
```

and use this as a starting point (e.g. with a different algorithm):

```{r}
testModel <- adam(forecast::taylor, "MMdM", lags=c(1,48,336), silent=FALSE, h=336, holdout=TRUE, B=testModel$B)
testModel
```

Finally, we can speed up the process by using a different initialisation of the state vector, such as backcasting:

```{r}
testModel <- adam(forecast::taylor, "MMdM", lags=c(1,48,336), silent=TRUE, h=336, holdout=TRUE, initial="b")
```

The result might be less accurate than in case of the optimisation, but it should be faster.

In addition, you can specify some parts of the initial state vector or some parts of the persistence vector, here is an example:

```{r}
testModel <- adam(forecast::taylor, "MMdM", lags=c(1,48,336), silent=TRUE, h=336, holdout=TRUE,
                  initial=list(level=30000, trend=1), persistence=list(beta=0.1))
testModel
```


The function also handles intermittent data (the data with zeroes) and the data with missing values. This is partially covered in the vignette on the [oes()](oes.html) function. Here is a simple example:

```{r}
testModel <- adam(rpois(120,0.5), "MNN", silent=FALSE, h=12, holdout=TRUE, occurrence="odds-ratio")
testModel
```

Finally, `adam()` is faster than `es()` function, because its code is more efficient and it uses a different optimisation algorithm by with more finely tuned parameters by default. Let's compare:
```{r}
adamModel <- adam(M3[[2568]], "CCC", lags=c(1,12))
esModel <- es(M3[[2568]], "CCC")
"adam:"
adamModel
"es():"
esModel
```


# ADAM ARIMA
As mentioned above, ADAM does not only contain ETS, it also contains ARIMA model, which is regulated via `orders` parameter. If you want to have a pure ARIMA, you need to switch off ETS, which is done via `model="NNN"`:

```{r}
testModel <- adam(M3[[1234]], "NNN", silent=FALSE, orders=c(0,2,2))
testModel
```

Given that both models are implemented in the same framework, they can be compared using information criteria.

The functionality of ADAM ARIMA is similar to the one of `msarima` function in `smooth` package, although there are several differences.

First, changing the `distribution` parameter will allow switching between additive / multiplicative models. For example, `distribution="dlnorm"` will create an ARIMA, equivalent to the one on logarithms of the data:

```{r}
testModel <- adam(M3[[2568]], "NNN", silent=FALSE, lags=c(1,12), orders=list(ar=c(1,1),i=c(1,1),ma=c(2,2)), distribution="dlnorm")
testModel
```

Second, it does not have intercept. If you want to have one, you can do this reintroducing ETS component and imposing some restrictions:

```{r}
testModel <- adam(M3[[2568]], "ANN", silent=FALSE, persistence=0,
                  lags=c(1,12), orders=list(ar=c(1,1),i=c(1,1),ma=c(2,2)), distribution="dnorm")
testModel
```

This way we get the global level, which acts as an intercept. The drift is not supported in the model either.

Third, you can specify parameters of ARIMA via the `arma` parameter in the following manner:

```{r}
testModel <- adam(M3[[2568]], "NNN", silent=FALSE, lags=c(1,12), arma=list(ar=c(0.1,0.1), ma=c(-0.96, 0.03, -0.12, 0.03)),
                  orders=list(ar=c(1,1),i=c(1,1),ma=c(2,2)), distribution="dnorm")
testModel
```

Finally, the initials for the states can also be provided, although getting the correct ones might be a challenging task (you also need to know how many of them to provide; checking `testModel$initial` might help):

```{r}
testModel <- adam(M3[[2568]], "NNN", silent=FALSE, lags=c(1,12), initial=list(arima=M3[[2568]]$x[1:24]),
                  orders=list(ar=c(1,1),i=c(1,1),ma=c(2,0)), distribution="dnorm")
testModel
```

If you work with ADAM ARIMA model, then there is no such thing as "usual" bounds for the parameters, so the function will use the `bounds="admissible"`, checking the AR / MA polynomials in order to make sure that the model is stationary and invertible (aka stable).

Similarly to ETS, you can use different distributions and losses for the estimation. **Note that the order selection for ARIMA is done in `auto.adam` function, not in the `adam`!**

Finally, ARIMA is typically slower than ETS, mainly because the `maxeval` is set by default to 400. But this is inevitable due to an increased complexity of the model - otherwise it won't be estimated properly. If you want to speed things up, use `initial="backcasting"` and reduce the number of iterations.
